## Why Developing our own Game Engine?

Game Engines are popular nowadays. Each day tons of new engines pop up. We aims to be different. We want to bring developers, even beginners the joy to program and make their own games. SFML's API is easy to understand, but requires lots of code to accomplish a single game. We help to reduce the code load and keep the API easy to use.
